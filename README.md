# Free tiers for AI and LLM APIs, with the date we read each one

31 records for vendors that serve models behind an API, each one carrying the date we last read the vendor's own page and the URL we read it on. There is no single freshness stamp for this file, because a single stamp for a list nobody re-read is worth nothing.

Generated from the free-tier catalogue at https://agentdeals.dev, which is where each row's record lives. It is regenerated whenever those records move, so editing it by hand is pointless — the next run overwrites it. The code that writes it is https://github.com/robhunter/agentdeals/blob/main/src/llm-api-readme.ts, so every rule this file states can be read against the rule it applies.

What this file has that a hand-kept list does not: **the terms a vendor replaced, next to the terms it replaced them with, with the date.** 4 rows carry that today.

Rows are ordered alphabetically by vendor. That is not a ranking: we publish no best free LLM API, and no position in this file is a recommendation.

## What is in this file, and what is left out

A record is published here when it carries one of four subtype labels, and by nothing else. A label is a reading of the vendor's own page, stored on the record with the sentence it was read from, so what this file holds is decided by the catalogue and not by a list kept here.

- `llm_api` — the vendor runs language or multimodal models on its own infrastructure and sells calls to them by model name; you send a prompt and receive a completion
- `model_gateway` — one endpoint that reaches models run by several independent providers; what is sold is the routing, key management and fallback, not the weights
- `model_hosting` — you supply or select a model and the platform serves it behind an endpoint on hardware you choose
- `embeddings_api` — returns a vector for text or media so it can be compared to other vectors; the vector is the output, not a completion

31 records carry one of those. The catalogue holds them under **AI / ML** and **AI Coding**, and 53 records there are left out. Each is left out for a stated reason, counted here so the size of each reason is visible:

| | Records | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `not_read_against_subtypes` | 22 | We have not read this record against any subtype taxonomy, so we hold no basis for saying it serves models. That states what we have not done rather than a finding about the product, and it stops applying the day the record is classified. |
| `no_subtype_applies` | 8 | We have read this record against the taxonomy and none of its subtypes applies, so it is not one of the kinds of product those labels describe. |
| `another_function` | 23 | The record is labelled, and every label it carries names a different function — observability, evaluation, labelling, generation and the rest are not the serving of a model behind an API. |

A record left out is not a record we are hiding: every one of them is published in full at https://agentdeals.dev, and `not_read_against_subtypes` in particular measures our own reading rather than the product.

Nothing else keeps a record out. A record whose terms name no free price is still published here, with the terms we read and no rating — leaving it out would hide the one reading a reader most needs to see.

## What the rows publish

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Records | 31 |
| Carrying a rating | 14 |
| Recorded as ended | 2 |
| Publishing a reason instead of a rating | 15 — `no_source` 8, `gate:not_a_free_offer` 3, `does_not_name_vendor` 1, `reading_names_no_price_of_nothing` 1, `states_no_terms` 1, `unreadable` 1 |
| Showing the terms they replaced | 4 |
| Carrying a caveat about our own reading | 0 |

Those counts are generated with the rows. If most of a column carries a caveat, that is a fact about this catalogue and it belongs in the open.

## How to read a row

**The terms** are either a sentence quoted from the vendor's own page on the day we read it, or our own record of that page, and the row says which. Where a change record supersedes what we stored, the row shows the quoted reading first and the terms it replaced underneath, with the date they stopped being current. 4 rows carry that second line, and it is the whole point of this file.

**Rating** is one of four values:

- `stable`, `caution` or `risky` — always printed beside the single dated record that produced it;
- `ended` — a free tier we recorded going away. The row stays for the record;
- `unrated` — we are publishing no rating, and the next column says why. 15 of 31 rows are unrated. A record whose page we could not read, that names no terms we can read, that is not a free offer, whose terms name no free price, or whose link has stopped resolving gets the reason instead of a verdict. We would rather print why we cannot say than guess.

**Record verified** is the day we last confirmed that record against the page. Where the link has not resolved for 14 days, we withhold that date and print the day the link last worked instead: a recent date over a destination that no longer answers is the most confident-looking thing on a page and the least true.

We re-read records on a rolling schedule. 0 rows say in the row that we have not re-read them within our 92-day interval. That is a statement about us, not about the vendor. Where a link has stopped resolving, the row says that instead, because we cannot re-read a page that does not answer.

## What counts as a free tier here

A record's tier is free text written by whoever read the page. It is classified by rule, not by a list of approved names, so a tier nobody has seen before is never silently dropped.

These tier names are **not** a free offer. A record carrying one is still published here, with the reason, but it is never rated:

- `^paid$` — no free offer at all
- `^freemium$` — a paid product with a trial-shaped entry point, not a stated free tier
- `^pay[-\s]?as[-\s]?you[-\s]?go$` — usage-billed from the first request
- `^pay[-\s]?per[-\s]?use\b` — usage-billed from the first request
- `^legacy free$` — a free tier closed to new accounts
- `^conditional$` — an offer whose availability is not stated in terms we can check
- `^exempt\s*\/\s*paid$` — free only by case-by-case exemption

These are free but **time-limited** — the free part runs out:

- `credit` — a credit grant that runs out
- `\btrial\b` — a trial that expires
- `scholarship` — a scholarship award, not an ongoing tier
- `\bbeta\b|preview|sandbox` — a beta/preview/sandbox allowance that may end without notice

Anything else is an ongoing free tier. 2 records are recorded as ended (`an offer the vendor has ended`); they stay in the file because a free tier that has gone is the thing hardest to find out elsewhere.

A tier name is not the last word, because a tier field is older than the terms printed beside it. Where the terms a row publishes name no price of nothing — no free plan, no zero price, nothing stated as costing nothing — that row carries no rating, whatever its tier says. One row is unrated for that reason today, and where we also hold a dated record of the free tier being removed the row reads `ended` instead, because then we have the removal and not only its shadow.

That test runs on the terms **every** row publishes. It is not restricted to the rows carrying a newer reading, because a row we have never re-read is the one whose tier field is oldest.

## What counts as a change

A change is one dated record about one vendor, carrying the terms before, the terms after, and the URL we read them on. Re-reading a page and finding it unchanged is not a change and produces no record.

**Narrows the terms:** `free_tier_removed`, `open_source_killed`, `limits_reduced`, `pricing_restructured`, `product_deprecated`, `restriction`, `pricing_model_change`. Only these can move a rating.

**Widens them:** `limits_increased`, `new_free_tier`, `new_tier`, `startup_program_expanded`, `pricing_postponed`. A vendor cannot be rated caution for any of these.

**Neither:** `rebranded`, `record_corrected`. `record_corrected` is us correcting our own entry, not the vendor changing anything.

A rating is decided by the *type* of the most recent narrowing record, never by how many records we hold. A vendor we have never had cause to examine reads the same as one with a long clean history — `stable` is a statement about our records, not a clean bill of health.

## Corrections

Every row links to the vendor's page on https://agentdeals.dev, which carries the full record, every change we have recorded for that vendor, and the source URL for each one. If a row here is wrong, the record behind it is wrong: file it at https://github.com/robhunter/agentdeals/issues and it is fixed at the source, in this file and on the site together.

Ratings are never for sale, and no vendor can ask to be added, removed or re-rated. https://agentdeals.dev/criteria is the whole method.
